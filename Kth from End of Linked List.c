/*   You are given the head of a linked list and the number k, You have to return the kth node from the end of linkedList. If k is more than the number of nodes, then the return -1.

Examples

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9, k = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9. The 2nd node from end is 8.

Input: LinkedList: 10->5->100->5, k = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: The given linked list is 10->5->100->5. Since 'k' is more than the number of nodes, the output is -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 106
1 ≤ node->data , x ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ 106   */
