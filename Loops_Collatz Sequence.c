/*  Write a program to generate the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer n. Starting with any positive integer n, Collatz sequence is defined corresponding to n as the numbers formed by the following operations :

If n is even, then n = n / 2.
If n is odd, then n = 3*n + 1.
Repeat above steps, until it becomes 1.
Input Format

A single integer n.
Constraints

1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5
Output Format

A single line containing the sequence of numbers, separated by a ( -> ).
Sample Input 0

6
Sample Output 0

6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
Sample Input 1

15
Sample Output 1

15 -> 46 -> 23 -> 70 -> 35 -> 106 -> 53 -> 160 -> 80 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
