/*   You are given an array of integers arr[]. You have to reverse the given array.

Note: Modify the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].
Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are [4, 5, 2]. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4].
Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105   */
