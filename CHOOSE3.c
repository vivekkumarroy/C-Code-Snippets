In a competition, four different functions are observed. All the functions use a single for loop and within the for loop, same set of statements are executed.

Consider the following for loops:

  A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
 
  B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2)
 
  C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2)
 
  D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2)
If n is the size of input(positive), which function is the most efficient? In other words, which loop completes the fastest.
